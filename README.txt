Author: Mirza Haračić
Version: 1.0
Description: 
A modern, responsive portfolio website template with dark/light mode, smooth scroll animations, project grid, and a contact form with modal popup. Perfect for freelancers, designers, and developers.

Contents:
---------
1. index.html          - Main HTML file
2. style.css           - Main CSS styles
3. script.js           - JavaScript for animations, dark/light toggle, and modal
4. images/             - Folder containing profile and project images

How to Use:
----------
1. Unzip the files into a folder on your computer.
2. Open index.html in your browser to view the template.
3. Replace images in the 'images' folder with your own.
4. Update text content in HTML files as needed (About, Projects, Contact).
5. Optional: host the site using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any web hosting service.
6. No additional setup is required; the template works out-of-the-box.

Notes:
------
- Ensure that the folder structure remains the same when editing files.
- All scripts and CSS are linked relatively, so moving files without preserving structure may break the layout.
- Feel free to customize colors in style.css under :root to match your branding.
